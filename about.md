I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), advised by Professor [Barbara Engelhardt](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/bee) and Professor [Kai Li](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/li). My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. I have been focusing on developing scalable and robust Bayesian nonparametric models for analyzing high-dimensional observational time series data from real-world Electronic Health Records (EHRs). 

Besides my main PhD work, I also have colloborations on a variety of [research projects]({{ site.url }}/projects), such as recommending clinical actions using reinforcement learning, analyzing mobile health time series data, and reconstructing isoforms from RNA-seq data. Before starting at Princeton, I received my MS and BS from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/).
