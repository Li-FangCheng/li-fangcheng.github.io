I am currently a senior data scientist and a technical lead on the Sensors Data Science team at [Verily Life Sciences](https://verily.com/){:target="_blank"}. I have been focusing on developing machine learning models for Verily's Study Watch applications, such as monitoring Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) (also see more details about Verily-iRhythm's [ZioÂ® Watch](https://verily.com/blog/fda-green-lights-irhythm-verily-zio-watch-and-zeus-system/){:target="_blank"} project).

Before joining Verily, I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by Professor [Barbara Engelhardt](https://profiles.stanford.edu/barbara-engelhardt){:target="_blank"} and Professor [Kai Li](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/li){:target="_blank"}. My primary research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and digital health. I have been focusing on developing scalable and robust models for analyzing high-dimensional observational time series data from real-world Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and mobile devices. 

Besides my main PhD work, I also have colloborations on a variety of research projects, such as recommending clinical actions using reinforcement learning, analyzing mobile health time series data, and reconstructing isoforms from RNA-seq data. Before starting at Princeton, I received my MS and BS from [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/){:target="_blank"}.
